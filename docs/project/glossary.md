# Glossary

Terms used across VeriLib verification projects. Adapted from the [VeriLib glossary](https://verilib.org/glossary).

## Verification Statuses

This document defines verification statuses for software verification projects across multiple proof frameworks (Rust only, Rust with Verus, Lean only, Rust with Lean and Aeneas).

## Atom Kinds

Atoms are classified into two kinds based on their role in verification:

| Kind | Description | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Implementation** | Executable code that can have specs attached | Rust functions, Verus exec-defs, Aeneas-generated Lean defs |
| **Specification** | Logical statements that define or prove properties | Verus spec-defs and proof fn, Lean theorem, lemma, non-translation defs |

**Key distinction:** Implementations can have specifications attached to them. Specifications cannot — they ARE the specs.

## Verification Status

Applies to both implementation and specification atoms.

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `transitively-verified` | Verified and all transitive dependencies are also verified or trusted |
| `verified` | Compiles successfully, all proofs discharged (but at least one transitive dep may be unverified/failed) |
| `unverified` | Has sorries, admits, or warnings |
| `failed` | Has compile errors |
| `trusted` | Axiomatically assumed (e.g., axiom, `#[verifier::external_body]`) |
| `null` | Not subject to verification (test functions, constants) |

The distinction between `transitively-verified` and `verified` is computed by `probe enrich` (reverse-BFS contamination over the dependency graph). probe-verus and probe-aeneas run this enrichment automatically as the last step of `extract`.

## Specification Status

Applies to implementations only.

| Status | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| `specified` | Has associated specs (specs list is non-empty) |
| `unspecified` | No associated specs (specs list is empty or null) |

Specifications are always `unspecified` by definition — they cannot have specs attached to them.

## Color Mapping

Colors provide visual feedback based on verification progress. The scheme follows a progression from untracked to fully verified, with a separate branch for trusted/axiomatic items.

**Verification scope:** Green comes in two strengths depending on whether explicit contamination (`unverified` or `failed`) exists in the transitive dependency closure:

- **Transitively verified** (`verification-status: "transitively-verified"`): The function is verified and no transitive dependency is explicitly `unverified` or `failed`. Dependencies with missing `verification-status` (untracked Rust functions, spec functions) and dependencies absent from the atom map are transparent — they do not block transitive scope. Trusted (axiomatic) dependencies are also transparent.
- **Locally verified** (`verification-status: "verified"`): The function is verified, but at least one transitive dependency is explicitly `unverified` or `failed`.

## Implementation Colors

Colors apply to Rust functions from the project under analysis — that is, atoms with `language: "rust"` and a non-empty `code-path`. Stubs with `code-path: ""` represent functions from external crates and are excluded from color assignment and counting.

| # | Color | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Grey | Not subject to verification, disabled (`is-disabled: true`), or excluded |
| 2 | White | Tracked (`is-disabled: false`) but not yet translated (Aeneas) or no spec written (Verus/Lean) |
| 3 | Yellow | Translated (e.g., Rust→Lean via Aeneas) but not yet specified |
| 4 | Light Blue | Has specs but not yet validated (placeholder — see note) |
| 5 | Dark Blue | Has specs and those specs have been validated |
| 6 | Light Green | Verified but at least one transitive dependency is unverified or failed |
| 7 | Dark Green | Verified and no transitive dependency is unverified or failed |
| — | Purple | Intentionally assumed correct — axiomatic or excluded from verification |

## Color Priority

The progression from least to most verified:

Grey → White → Yellow → Light Blue → Dark Blue → Light Green → Dark Green

Purple (Trusted) indicates intentional axiomatic assumptions rather than incomplete work.

!!! note "Spec validation"
    All specs are currently considered validated if they appear in the JSON — to be present, the spec must be on `main`, meaning it passed PR review. Light Blue is kept as a placeholder for future spec-invalidation support; until then, all specified-but-unverified functions are Dark Blue.

## Counting Rust Functions

Use `scripts/count-colors.sh` to count Rust project functions per color. Auto-detects `probe-aeneas/extract` and `probe-verus/extract` JSON:

```bash
scripts/count-colors.sh input.json
```

The script scopes to project functions (`code-path != ""`), excluding external crate stubs. Grey includes test functions. Grey, White, Yellow, Dark Blue, and Purple form a partition of the total; Green is an informational overlay within Dark Blue (verified subset of specified functions). Functions that are specified but not yet verified (`unverified` or `failed`) are counted in Dark Blue but not in Green.

## Specification Colors

Specifications skip Grey, White, Yellow, and Blue tiers — they ARE the specs. Only three colors apply:

| Color | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Light Green | Locally verified |
| Dark Green | Transitively verified |
| Purple | Trusted (axiomatic) |

## Rust Only

Functions are Grey (untracked) — no formal verification framework is in use, so no verification will be performed.

## Rust with Verus

**Implementations (exec-defs):**

In Verus, spec validation and proof happen atomically in a single verifier pass — you cannot have "specs validated but function not verified." Therefore Blue tiers (which represent the gap between spec authoring and proof) do not apply. Blue tiers are meaningful for Lean/Aeneas where spec authoring and proof are separable steps.

| Condition | Color |
| --- | --- |
| Proofs complete, no explicit unverified/failed in transitive deps | Dark Green |
| Proofs complete, at least one transitive dep is explicitly unverified/failed | Light Green |
| Subject to verification, but no pre/post conditions yet | White |
| `#[verifier::external_body]` (intentionally excluded) | Purple |
| `#[test]` function | Grey |

**Specifications (proof fn, spec-defs):**

| Condition | Color |
| --- | --- |
| Proofs complete, no explicit unverified/failed in transitive deps | Dark Green |
| Proofs complete, at least one transitive dep is explicitly unverified/failed | Light Green |
| Trusted assumption (intentionally axiomatic) | Purple |

## Lean Only

**Implementations (def with associated theorems):**

| Condition | Color |
| --- | --- |
| Has specs, all proven, no explicit unverified/failed in transitive deps | Dark Green |
| Has specs, all proven, at least one transitive dep is explicitly unverified/failed | Light Green |
| Has specs, specs validated (proven) | Dark Blue |
| Has specs, specs not yet validated | Light Blue |
| Subject to verification, but no specs | White |
| Not subject to verification | Grey |

**Specifications (theorem, lemma, standalone def):**

| Condition | Color |
| --- | --- |
| Compiles successfully, no explicit unverified/failed in transitive deps | Dark Green |
| Compiles successfully, at least one transitive dep is explicitly unverified/failed | Light Green |
| axiom declaration (intentionally axiomatic) | Purple |

## Rust with Lean and Aeneas

Aeneas translates Rust functions to Lean definitions, which can then be specified and verified.

**Structure:**

- Each Rust function → one Lean translation (def)
- A translation may call other translations (e.g., loop bodies)
- Each translation may have one or more specs (theorems)
- One spec is the primary spec; others are auxiliary lemmas

**Status inheritance:**

- A Lean translation is `specified` if it has a primary spec
- The Rust function inherits status from its Lean translation
- External function stubs → `trusted` (Purple)

**Color assignment:**

| Condition | Color |
| --- | --- |
| Primary spec proven, no explicit unverified/failed in transitive deps | Dark Green |
| Primary spec proven, at least one transitive dep is explicitly unverified/failed | Light Green |
| Primary spec written and validated | Dark Blue |
| Primary spec written but not validated | Light Blue |
| Has translation, no spec | Yellow |
| Tracked, no translation | White |
| External stub (intentionally excluded; `code-path: ""`) | Purple |
| Untracked/disabled | Grey |

## Open Questions

1. Should `failed` have its own color (red) distinct from `unverified`?
2. How to identify the "primary spec"? Options: naming convention (e.g., `foo_spec` for function `foo`), annotation system in Lean, or first spec in declaration order.
3. Should Translated use Yellow or Light Purple? Yellow distinguishes it more clearly from the Blue tiers; Light Purple groups it visually closer to Purple.
4. For Aeneas Rust atoms, `is-relevant == !is-disabled` (both derived from `functions.json`). `is-disabled` is the canonical field; should `is-relevant` be removed from Rust atom enrichment as redundant? See [probe-aeneas#20](https://github.com/Beneficial-AI-Foundation/probe-aeneas/issues/20).
